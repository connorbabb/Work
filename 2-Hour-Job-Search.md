## Step 1 - Prioritize

### List (40 Minutes):
- 98.7% of employers have less than 100 employees. They are small and don't have a lot of outreach budget. Find them first. Larger firms don't need to try hard to find applicants, they are happy with good and easy.
- The LAMP list helps you to narrow down prospects and focus on the best 5 or so.
- Don't take the time to apply to an interesting one right away, you will lose your efficiency.
- Don't worry about a posting closing, an employer will always make an exception for an internal referral.
- Focusing on talking to employers rather than job postings gets to the source, and you learn more from experts. This is way more motivating and teaches you about the market, which other employers will usually ask about.
- Where is my passion? Passion will build the drive and knowledge, and employers hire people out of knowlwedge and passion. So find where my passion lies.
- I think one of my best skills is organization and the efficiency that comes from that.
- The 4 most common groups of employers, 10 minutes or 10 employers to each: (1) Dream Employers. (2) Alumni. (3) Actively Hiring Employers. (4) Trending Employers.
1. Dream Employers (Ponder, Research, LinkedIn):
    - Add employers you have always aspired to work for.
    - Try googling or researching companies that you think you would be a good with fit with, "companies in Phoenix" or "companies focused on new products" "companies using Python".
    - If struggling to find companies. Go to LinkedIn search one dream company, click on their page, and scroll down till you see the people also viewed on the right. These pages are similar, add them to the list. This works better by starting with smaller companies though.
2. Alumni (LinkedIn School Database):
    - Use BYUI on LinkedIn and filter for my career and maybe location. 
    - When you find a company in this database, copy them down, but not the Alumni!
    - Join LinkedIn groups for subjects that would be beneficial for you to learn about.
    - Highlight these employers now in some way which will save us time later on in the process.
3. Actively Hiring Employers (Job Search Engines):
    - Author uses Indeed.com most frequently.
    - Use show all for results.
    - Very simple step, just stay focused. Personally, probably focus on one engine at a time each LAMP list you do.
4. Trending Employers (News Articles):
    - Pick an industry or function like machine learning, google that with the words 'trends'. 
    - Or, google a list of venture capital firms(like Sequoia Capital and Accel). This will show which companies that employers are excited to invest in and why.
    - Or, look up kickstarts that have headquarters near you using 'Crunchbase'. 

Once you have your forty, sort alphabetically, and remove duplicates if any.

### Advocacy (10 Minutes):

We need to find out if we have advocates at these companies, go through the list 3 times:
1. Put a 'y' next to any company that you can immediately name a friend/family member.
2. Has at least one Alumni at the company, see below for steps.
3. Filter LinkedIn for just the company name, see if there is anyone that lives close or has a similar experience.
4. Fill in all other companies with 'n'.

To find out if there are alumni at a certain company easiest, follow these steps:
1. Go to LinkedIn, press enter in the search box to bring up the custom filters.
2. Click People.
3. Go to all filters and scroll down to schools and select BYUI.
4. Then click the current companies filter and type and autocomplete a company by clicking on one.
5. If people show up for that company then it is a yes.

Remember if you highlighted in the last step to just put a 'y' for that company. Or put a 'y' for any company that you know has a friend or family member working there. Then do the same thing but for people that live very close to you.

### Motivation (5 Minutes):

Go down the list and rate your motivation from 0-3. Reserve 0s for employers we don't know enough about and we can research later.

### Postings (15 Minutes):

Online job postings are pretty bad at getting you a job, but they provide great Meta information.
1. Use Indeed.com or similar sites.
2. Search for the posting by putting in the 'What' box the company name then a likely keyword like 'software developer'. Don't click on anything, just look at the job title, location, brief description. Remember to use "" around the job title/keyword, but NOT the company.
3. If there is a relevant posting at the company it gets a 3. If not search for any postings from that company by getting rid of the keyword, if there is one, it gets a 2. If there are no postings, it gets a 1.

### Sort your List:

1. On your google sheet, highlight all data except header row, click data, sort range, first sort by column C and click add additional sort columns, then put D then put B, all sort Z to A instead of A to Z. This will prioritize those to the top based on those 3 columns.
2. Look at your 0s and research those companies for a couple minutes each, then change their scores to either a 1, 2, 3, or even a 4.

## Step 2 - Contact

### Naturalize (20 Minutes):

Our LAMP list was all about finding our best contacts or employers. Contact is all about identifying and finding contacts for people at companies, we are looking at the top 5 companies here.

Responses to our emails are about 20-40% so getting two contacts per employer is really important. We may even go back to find a 3rd or 4th later on.

The following hierarchy of traits for identifying starter contacts for each of our Top 5, in order of importance:
1. Their **position** is functionally relevant to the one you are seeking.
2. They are fellow **alumni** or members of your preferred affinity group.
3. They hold a position **one to two levels above** where you would start.
4. They have already been **promoted** at that organization.
5. They have a **unique name**.

To find these people:
1. Go to LinkedIn and go to the same custom search bar, click People and search the company.
2. When viewing this page, there are probably too many people if it's not a super small company, filter for title first like (Software, Engineer, Computer, maybe Manager).
3. If there are still a lot of results, you can try searching for alumni by adding your school.
4. By now there should be less than 10, click through each and search for those that are one to levels above you, and have had multiple job titles within that same organization. 
5. As a final tie-breaker, pick someone that has a unique name, this will make finding their contact information easier.
6. Write down 2 names down next to the company name on your LAMP list.

*DO NOT Click through a ton of random profiles, you can reach a search limit. Only click once you narrow down.*

Hierarchy for finding contact information:
- Contact method #1: LinkedIn Groups
    - You want to go to the groups page and search for them there, this will bring up a message option that is free and always available.
    - Join up to 100 groups for free, anything that aligns with your interests.
- Contact method #2: Direct email
    - Use Alumni database first, there isn't really a better one besides BYUI Connect, ugh:
        - https://ces.peoplegrove.com/hub/ces/person
    - Use a email finder website like www.hunter.io
    - Maybe they have an email on their profile?
    - Use maximum 5 minutes.
- Contact method #3: LinkedIn invitations to connect
    - Use this method with a 6-point email type message, don't just connect.
- Contact method #4: Facebook/Twitter/other social media
    - Use this sparignly, if these first few just don't work for whatever reason.
- Contact method #5: LinkedIn second-degree connections
    - Use someone that you are close with and it can't be someone you haven't talked to in 5 years. This is used very very rarely.

### The 6-Point Email (20 Minutes):

We need to keep our email brief, and not spammy, that means not long and no hyperlinks. It is asking for a favor, not explaining why you are qualified.

- Point #1: Write fewer than **seventy-five** words.
- Point #2: Ask for **insight and advice**, not job leads.
- Point #3: **State your connection** first.
- Point #4: Make your request in the **form of a question** (ending in “?”).
- Point #5: **Define your interest** both narrowly and broadly.
- Point #6: Keep **over half the word count about the contact**, not about you.

Subject: Your product management experience at Red Hat

Hi Jeff,

I’m Brooke, a fellow Duke MBA (’22). May I chat with you for a few minutes about your product management experience at Red Hat?

I am trying to learn more about product management in the North Carolina tech space, so your insights would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Brooke
```

If you already applied and you want to let them know:
```
Hi Patricia,

I’m Adrian, a fellow member of the EdTech LinkedIn Group. May I have a few minutes to ask you about your sales experience at Enspire Learning?

Your insights would be greatly appreciated, since I’m now in the process of deciding whether to apply for your open Business Development Intern position.

Best regards,

Adrian
```

Note: You don't need to apply to the posting before reaching out. In fact, you should try to get an informational first before applying, at least 2 weeks.

Mentioning the contact in the first sentence or two is also very important:

```
Subject: Your interview in last month’s Science magazine

Hi Dr. Johnson,

I’m just completing my biology degree at Case Western Reserve University, and I found your thoughts on the Cleveland Clinic’s trial use of nanomachines to address certain forms of cancer in last month’s issue of Science to be very interesting.

Would you mind discussing your work further with me in a brief phone chat? I had a few follow-up questions, and your insights would be invaluable.

Thank you for your time,

Caroline Thomas
```

Even if the company isn't hiring, still take the call if offered, they could still hire you down the line, or very soon! And information and advice is always good.

Make sure to list my contact information at the end of every email and message. I have this done auto in Gmail, for LinkedIn use a Chrome Extension called Magical, type '//!sig'.

### Track (10 Minutes): 

Instead of an excel spreadsheet use a calendar app, this helps you know what you need to do today, not what you have done or need to do in the future.

3B7 Process:
1. Whenever you send an email to a new contact you put in three calendar events, one for 3 business days later, one for 7 business days later, and one for 8 days later.
2. If you get a reminder for '3B John Microsoft', that means send an email to a 2nd contact at Microsoft, if the first one never responded. Then you put another 3 events for another 3B, 7B, and 8B
3. If you reach a 7B ike '7B Tim Micron' that means to follow up with the same contact from a week ago. This process continues, until you get a response or exhaust all resources, or lose motivation for being ignored so much, but both of these situations are rare!
4. If you get a response from anyone, set up an informational following the availability they put, if they don't put any offer many days and time. Cancel all follow-ups and 3Bs at that company in your calendar.
5. Apply online to jobs at their company after 8 days of following 3B7, that means 2 contacts and one follow-up with no success. This is a recommendation from the author, but I'm just making it an official part of the process.

```
Subject: RE: Your project management experience at BiffCo

Hi Ed,

Thank you for your quick response and willingness to chat. Over the next week, I am free after 1pm on both Monday and Tuesday as well as all day on Wednesday—will any of those times work for you?

Thank you again,

Steve
```

Do not mention in your 2nd contact that you already reached out to someone else, for obvious reasons.

For your 7B or follow-up email you can do something like this, after clicking reply all:
```
Subject: RE: Your project management experience at BiffCo

Hi Ed,

I just wanted to follow up on my message from last week. Might this week be a more convenient time for you to chat about your BiffCo experience? Please let me know if so!

Best regards,

Steve
```

You could also just copy and paste, as if the first email never happened, this reduces awkwardness, but if you don't care about that then do this instead.

If you happen to have two responses from the same firm, do two informationals, you never know if one is unhelpful and the other is.

If they respond much later down the line, if you are in better cases by this point, simply explain where you are and wish them a nice day.

Start slow on this process and if you can handle doing more than 5 than do it, but to start out it is rare that you can handle the process doing more than 5 companies. Probably after 3 rounds you might be able to add a 6th or 7th.

## Step 3 - Convince

### Research (15 Minutes):

There are two goals in any informational, gather information and build rapport. Rapport being the more important of the two, since information can be gathered later if the interviewer likes you.

Remember to use the 80/20 rule, we need to gather 80% of the information we need in 20% of the time. We don't need to be experts.

At a minimum, you should check three references prior to any informational meeting:
1. Investor relations pages on an employer’s website.
2. Headlines on the front page of the employer’s website.
3. Google results for recent employer headlines (and informational interviewers themselves).

- Look for annual reports and K-10 forms where the CEO gives a SWOT analysis.
- You really don't want to go into an interview with the first question from them being, "Did you see our big headline this week?"
- Don't speak about anything negative, as the interviewer will attribute this negativity to you down the line.
- Search for the interviewer's name and their company to see if any articles or information pops up.
- Review their LinkedIn once more.
- You want to find a connection and build rapport, but don't make it obvious that you stalked them and know everything about them, but when they ask, "tell me about yourself" try to fit in with them and share your interests that also align wit theirs.
- Remember to keep this 15 minutes, you don't want to feel like you need to flex to the interviewer.

The big four questions (Just focus on the first one for most informationals):
1. Tell me about yourself (aka “Walk me through your resume”).
2. Why do you want to work for our organization?
3. Why do you want to work in this role?
4. Why do you want to work in this sector/industry?

- This and all other answers should be 2 minutes max. 
- Use the FIT model, Favorite part, Insight gained, Transition made
```
In college I studied chemical engineering. My favorite part (F) of chemical engineering was using rigorous logic to break complex problems into smaller, simpler pieces. However, I wanted to apply that rigorous logic to a wider variety of challenges than chemical engineering allowed (I), so upon graduation, I decided to transition into strategy consulting (T).
```

You should make REC(Reason, Evidence, Connection) statements for up to 3 points that you want to highlight during your two-minute answer. 

For example, Why are you drawn to technology?
```
REASON: The first reason is my love of gadgets. I have been fascinated by gadgets and new technologies ever since I was a child.
EVIDENCE: When a lot of my peers were playing with Legos, I gravitated toward computers and electronics stores to see the latest and greatest technology; this passion has followed me into adulthood, where I am typically the first among my friends to know about and experience new products and services.
CONNECTION: My fascination with the industry and my constant consumption of news about it from sources ranging from Wired to Fast Company to Reddit gives me confidence I can quickly gain expertise on any product I might manage in the future.
```

- Note the connection is usually only appropriate for job interviews, not informationals.
- If they never ask a big four question, don't bring them up.
- Remember to smile and sit or stand up straight during the interview, it makes your voice sound more confident.
- If you can't find much information on the employer, then use the interview for information itself.

### Discuss (30 Minutes):

Here are 3 small talk questions to get the ball rolling, especially if you are bad at small talk:
1. How is your day going so far?
2. So what's been your path to joining <organization>?
3. What are you working on right now?

**Movement #1 Small Talk:**
- Remember to match their answer length, unless they go over 2 minutes, stay at 2 max, they should be the star of the show.
- If you get good enough information from 1 and 2, you can skip 3 and keep the ball rolling to something else.
- Expect this to go 5 minutes, but follow the flow, maybe even to 10 minutes, then transition, "Thank you again for meeting with me, I have a few questions I'd like to ask you if that's okay?"

**Movement #2 Q&A:**
Use TIARA method for the Q&A phase: **Trends**, **Insights**, **Advice**, **Resources**, and **Assignments**. This leads the conversation with the person taking them from an expert all the way to a mentor, as you notice as you go down the TIARA line.

A trick to keep it fun is to make it their opinions so they can't be wrong, use superlatives, like most interesting, or favorite.

- Trends: “What trend is most impacting your business right now?” “How do you predict your industry will change most dramatically in the next several years?”
- Insights: “What surprises you most about your job?” “What’s been your best professional decision so far, and why?”“If you had to attribute your ten years of success at your employer to one skill or trait, what would it be?”
- Advice: “If you were me, what would you be doing right now to best prepare for a career in this field?” “What do you know now that you wish you knew when you were in my position?” “If you were me, what would you be doing right now to maximize your chance of breaking into this industry or function?”
- Resources: “What resources should I be sure to look into next?”
    - Intentionally vague, maybe you are asking for a referral?? Or maybe just a an article or book. If they ask you to clarify, then lean into actual resources, never ask for a referral, you can ask for one later on.
    - “Are there any annual conferences/industry websites/LinkedIn Groups pertaining to your work that you find particularly helpful?” “What’s the most important ten minutes of research you do each week to stay current on your space?”
    - You need to send a follow-up/thank you email to them. And tell them you will follow-up with them in a week on the spot and in the email. Even if it is weeks late. Set up a reminder to thank them the day after. This acts as a receipt that says you talked to this person at this company, which is information later on.
    - This shows you didn't flake or anything, but it also gives the benefit of maybe getting more help.
    - Make sure to set up a one week reminder to follow-up with them on your progress with assignments they gave. Add another reminder for every month to update them on your progress.
    ```
    Thanks again for taking the time to speak to me—that information was very helpful! As promised, I wanted to provide you with an update on my status. Per your suggestion, I reached out to Wendy, but unfortunately we haven’t been able to connect. Do you have any suggestions for how to best proceed from here?”
    ```
- Assignments: “What’s been your favorite project so far?” “Has any particular type of project increased in popularity recently at your organization?”
    - Never tell them you are willing to do anything they need you do, this shows desparation. Instead share strengths and tell them what knowledge and skills you have.
    - Assignment questions can be cut if you get a referral or meaningful assignment, or the conversation seems to be drawing to a close.

**Movement #3 Next Steps:**
- This two part closer will thank them and make it clear that you will reach back out (probably to ask for referrals, unless they give you one there, which is rare):
```
Our time is up, but thank you so much for your time today. You’ve given me a lot to think about.I’m going to take the weekend to reflect on all you’ve shared, but if I have any additional questions, is it okay if I reach back out to you?
```
- If the informational starts with them saying they don't have much time, ask them to reschedule to a time when they might have 15-20 minutes to talk. If they decline, jump straight to Advice in the TIARA framework with a little bit of insights. “Given what you’ve learned in your time at your employer, what would you do, if you were me, to maximize your chances?”
- If they ask you to submit your questions over email, do a TAR framework.
- Set a reminder for a week from now to ask for a referral, when you send that first one set another reminder to ask again if they respond, if they still don't abandon the contact.

### Follow-Up (Ongoing):

After a month you should have a notification saying to follow-up, here is an example email:
```
Subject: Ad Age / Brand Week & update

Hi Jerry,

I wanted to send you a quick update. I found the insights you shared last month incredibly helpful, especially those on the increasing role of microsegmentation in the advertising space. Per your advice, I also started reading Brand Week and Ad Age, and I’m already feeling much more confident in my ability to discuss trends impacting ad agencies today.

Might you have any additional suggestions? Your insights are greatly appreciated, and I’ll certainly keep you posted of my progress.

Sincerely,

Ari
```

In subsequent months if your contact doesn't have any new advice, just make the emails more personal:
```
Subject: Checking in & update

Hi Anthony,

How are you? And how is your little one doing? Congratulations again to you and Kimberly on becoming new parents.On my end, my networking conversations are continuing. Your insights have been invaluable, though. I’ve had some traction with a few of the agencies you suggested, and I’m about to interview with one later this week.

Thanks again for your mentorship in this process, and I hope to have some good news to share with you in the near future!

Yours truly,

Ari
```

If they don't respond to one of these emails, wait for the next one, and frame it like a question, with a question mark at the end.

Remember: If you ask for the referral a week after the informational like normal and they don't respond, try again, if they don't respond again, abandon contact.

## Conclusion:

You got this!
