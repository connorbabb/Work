## Introduction
- Do very little applying online. Strategically sort through job postings.

## Step 1 - Prioritize

### List:
- 98.7% of employers have less than 100 employees. They are small and don't have outreach budget. Find them first. Larger firms don't need to try hard to find applicants, they are happy with good and easy.
- You can't control outcome, you can only control process.
- The LAMP list helps you to narrow down prospects and focus on the best ones.
- Don't take the time to apply to an interesting one right away, you will lose your efficiency.
- Don't worry about a posting closing, an employer will always make an exception for an internal referral.
- The four letters in LAMP are: 
    1. List all employers(40 minutes). Do more if you still have time, never less than 40. The more the merrier! With 40 there is a better chance to catch those smaller employers.
    2. Identify Advocates(10 minutes). 
    3. Assess Motivation(5 minutes). 
    4. Classify postings(15 minutes).
- Focusing on talking to employers rather than job postings gets to the source, and you learn more from experts. This is way more motivating and teaches you about the market, which other employers will usually ask about.
- Where is my passion? Passion will build the drive and knowledge, and employers hire people out of knowlwedge and passion. So find where my passion lies.
- I think one of my best skills is organization and the efficiency that comes from that.
- The 4 most common groups of employers, 10 minutes or 10 employers to each: (1) Dream Employers. (2) Alumni. (3) Actively Hiring Employers. (4) Trending Employers.
1. Dream Employers (Ponder, Research, LinkedIn):
    - Add employers you have always aspired to work for. Then enter their peers in the same L column.
    - Try googling or researching companies that you think you would be a good with fit with, "companies in Phoenix" or "companies focused on new products" "companies using Python".
    - If struggling to find companies. Go to LinkedIn search one dream company, click on their page, and scroll down till you see the people also viewed on the right. These pages are similar, add them to the list. This works better by starting with smaller companies though.
2. Alumni (LinkedIn School Database):
    - Use BYUI on LinkedIn and filter for my career and maybe location. 
    - When you find a company in this database, copy them down, but no the Alumni!
    - Join LinkedIn groups for subjects that would be beneficial for you to learn about.
    - Highlight these employers now in some way which will save us time later on in the process.
3. Actively Hiring Employers (Job Search Engines):
    - Author uses Indeed.com most frequently.
    - Use show all for results.
    - Very simple step, just stay focused. Personally, probably focus on one engine at a time each LAMP list you do.
4. Trending Employers (News Articles):
    - Pick an industry or function like machine learning, google that with the words 'trends'. 
    - Or, google a list of venture capital firms(like Sequoia Capital and Accel). This will show which companies that employers are excited to invest in and why.
    - Or, look up kickstarts that have headquarters near you using 'Crunchbase'. 

Once you have your forty, sort alphabetically, and remove duplicates.
